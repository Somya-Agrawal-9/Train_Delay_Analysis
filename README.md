# Train_Delay_Analysis

📌 Executive Summary
This project focuses on analyzing train delay data to identify key operational patterns, delay contributors, and improvement areas. The dashboard presents KPIs and interactive visuals to support business decision-making on train punctuality, congestion impact, and route efficiency.


📊 Key Features
Data cleaning and import using MySQL

KPI cards: Average delay, % trains delayed >10 mins, max delay


📊 Visuals

Lollipop chart: Avg delay by distance band

Bar chart: Avg delay by train type

Pie/Donut: % trains by route congestion

Interactive slicers: Day of week, weather conditions, train type

Power BI best practices: clean layout, consistent color coding, meaningful labels
